## Create Generate 
please (create/generate/make) a (program/groups/clusters/areas/zones) for (hotel / wahtever typology) with ( "some creative specifications" ) of (5000sqm/5000/ total 5000sqm/).

> always results in a program set of groups which match target total area in abstract level of detail always. (never divide into quanitites here yet, just abstract blob based on reasons)


## Unfold Divide (one area input only at one time)
please (unfold/grain/divide) (context selection ( one area per unfold) ) with focus on ( "some creative specifications" )


case 01 ( check if area is repetitive unit blob, if no ) > resuts in a new group which inhertis reasoning notes from area which is being splitted. and contains new areas with reasoning.
exmaple 01 ( please unfold with focus over tropical saunas and batterfly garden )

case 02 ( check if area is repetitive unit blob, if yes ) > resuts in a new group which inherits reasoning notes from area which is being splitted. and contains areas with quantities.
exmaple 02 (please divide area into typical rooms sizes ) > standart units x 20 20sqm, sweet units x 30 28sqm, king size untis x10 40sqm



## Organize Group Clusterize ( lot of areas or groups)
please (group, divide, organize, cluster, split ) >  results into organaized areas by group folders with reasoning in each folder, all areas should end p in some folder, folder amount is flexible

example ( please group areas by function or logical realtion, or by private public, or by any other sense of grouping )

if multiple areas without groups ( organaize into groups) if some groups exist already in selection ( then del groups and re organaize by prompt sepcific request)



## Chat Rules
one filter to add is (we never include circulation / core / mep spaces / lifts / stair cases) we think in high level of architecture concept. We value creative outputs and which help architect to narrow down program and explore idea, with precise reasoning over areas. We are not technical advisor, we are creative explorer with precise guess over areas and organization.

## Corner cases 
if prompt can't be interpreted into Create or Unfold or Organize type, we may give a meesage, that agent only supports Create or Unfold or Organaize functions yet.
