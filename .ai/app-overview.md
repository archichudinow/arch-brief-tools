# App Overview

## Name
**Arch Brief Tools** - AI-Assisted Architectural Program → Volume Tool

## Purpose
A web-based architectural tool that converts messy briefs (text or Excel) into:
- Normalized program data
- AI-assisted functional grouping & stacking logic
- Algorithmically valid volumetric/sectional variants
- Abstract 2D room geometry with correct areas
- Structured numeric outputs suitable for Excel review

## Target Use Case
- Early-stage feasibility studies
- Urban massing logic exploration
- Program stacking analysis
- Competition and concept-stage workflows

## NOT Designed For
- Detailed room layouts
- Circulation, cores, or structure
- Code compliance checking
- Construction or documentation drawings

## Core Principles
1. **AI suggests, never enforces** - AI proposes, human decides
2. **Algorithms guarantee correctness** - Areas, heights, footprints validated
3. **Human override always available** - UI toggles for all AI suggestions
4. **Abstract & proportional output** - Architectural quality, not precision
5. **Multi-building support** - Single building to complex urban scenarios

## Primary Visualization
Section-based view:
- Horizontal bars = levels
- Bar height = floor height
- Bar width = footprint
- Color = functional group
- Multiple stacks = multiple buildings/towers
