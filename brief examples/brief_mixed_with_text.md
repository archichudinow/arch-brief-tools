Project Overview
We are seeking to collaborate with UNStudio and ASPA-KST on an ambitious large-scale development project covering a total area of 315,172 sq.m. This is a prime location, directly adjacent to a metro and suburban railway station and located along Attiki Odos, the most significant ring road in Athens. Furthermore, the plot is very close to Athen’s international airport.
Our vision is to create a modern and sustainable office complex, integrated with complementary amenities and public spaces. The site is divided into several distinct zones, each requiring a unique architectural approach.

Core Development Area – Office Complex (Block 1)
The primary development zone, Block 1 (132,880 sq.m.), will house the office complex. The plan includes:
•
66,928 sq.m. of office space, built to high sustainability standards and certified under LEED.
•
8,000 sq.m. of Supporting facilities such as: a conference hall, multipurpose areas, a kindergarden and an experience center.
•
6,000 sq.m. of retail and amenities areas.
•
1,000 sq.m. of F&B areas.
•
18,350 sq.m. of outdoor parking, with additional underground parking solutions.
•
77,000 sq.m. of landscaped areas, including plazas, public spaces, and extensive greenery to enhance the work environment.
Cultural and Heritage Area (Block 2)
Block 2 will focus on heritage preservation and cultural activation. This 23,600 sq.m. former winery site contains 3.700 sq.m. of protected historic buildings of great architectural significance. 5,700 sq.m. of new development is to be added to the existing building stock, seamlessly integrated with the historic shells. Our vision for this includes:
•
Restoration and adaptive reuse of the existing structures.
•
A 500 sq.m. Wine Museum
•
A 1900 sq.m. boutique hotel
•
3,180 sq.m. of F&B areas.
•
2,000 sq.m. of leisure activities areas.
•
1,880 sq.m. of retail and amenities areas.
•
770 sq.m. of outdoor parking, with additional underground parking solutions.
•
14,200 sq.m. of landscaped areas, including plazas, public spaces, and greenery.
•
The cultural identity of the former winery should be a central theme, enriching the entire development and strengthening its character.
Historic Train Station Restoration (Block 3)
Block 3 contains a small historic train station (45 sq.m.) which will be fully restored and repurposed, as well as 1300 sq.m. of open space. The proposed function is a café and recreational space, preserving the site's heritage while integrating it into the larger development.
Extended Urban Design Zone
Beyond our own property, an additional 157,000 sq.m. will be incorporated into the masterplan, featuring:
•
Green areas, plazas, pedestrian walkways, and shared public spaces.
•
7,000 sq.m. of public sports facilities to serve the local community.

•
25,000 sq.m. of organic vineyards, with some planted near the former winery as a tribute to the site’s historical use as a vineyard landscape.
Strategic Vision
Our goal is to establish a state-of-the-art business hub, seamlessly integrated with a unique cultural and heritage destination. The development will provide a high-quality working environment with extensive amenities, while also serving as a landmark destination that enhances the urban fabric and benefits the local community.
We are looking forward to UNStudio’s expertise in innovative, sustainable, and people-centric design to help shape this vision into reality.
