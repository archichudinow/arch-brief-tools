PROJECT BRIEF
Civic Landscape & Cultural Exchange District
1. Project Vision

The project proposes a Civic Landscape & Cultural Exchange District that blurs the boundary between building and ground. Rather than a single object-building, the project is conceived as a porous campus composed of multiple volumes, courtyards, terraces, and public landscapes.

The complex serves as a cultural, educational, and social anchor for the city—hosting exhibitions, performances, learning spaces, workspaces, and public recreation. Outdoor areas are not secondary but form the primary organizing structure of the project.

2. Site Context (Assumed)

Site Area: 18,000 m²

Location: Edge between dense urban fabric and a natural feature (river, lake, or large urban park)

Edges:

North: Primary urban road

South: Open landscape / water body

East: Residential mid-rise blocks

West: Public transit + commercial strip

Climate Assumption: Warm–temperate / tropical (outdoor use encouraged year-round)

3. Design Objectives

Create a continuous public ground accessible 24/7

Layer programs from most public → most private

Integrate landscape as climate moderator (shade, evapotranspiration, airflow)

Use courtyards and terraces as social condensers

Enable multiple circulation loops (formal + informal)

Design for adaptability and phased construction
